# Azure VM Vulnerability Assessment — Cybersecurity Lab #1

## 📋 Project Overview

This project simulates a basic vulnerability assessment against a cloud-hosted virtual machine (VM) on Microsoft Azure.

The goal was to:
- Set up a cloud environment (Ubuntu VM)
- Expose services intentionally (SSH and HTTP)
- Scan for vulnerabilities using **Nmap** and **Nessus Essentials**
- Analyze findings and propose remediation actions

---

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

- **Cloud Provider:** Microsoft Azure
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- **Open Ports:** SSH (22), HTTP (80)
- **Public IP Address:** Dynamic (assigned by Azure)
- **Tools Used:** 
  - Nmap
  - Nessus Essentials

---

## 🔎 Key Findings

- SSH (port 22) exposed to the internet
- Apache HTTP (port 80) exposed without HTTPS
- No patch management or system updates applied

---

## 🛡️ Recommendations

- Restrict SSH access to specific IP addresses only
- Implement HTTPS for web services
- Apply regular security updates and patches
