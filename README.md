# ☁️ Azure Cloud Security Lab Series

Welcome to my **Azure Cloud Security Lab Series** – a personal journey into building, breaking, and securing cloud environments using Microsoft Azure 🔐

This repo documents practical, hands-on labs that demonstrate **core cloud security principles** in real environments.  
Each lab focuses on applying—not just understanding—concepts like:
- ✅ Least privilege and identity access
- 🧱 Network segmentation
- 📊 Actionable logging and alerting
- 🛡️ Vulnerability management and patching
- 🔄 Zero Trust enforcement
- 🚨 Detection and response workflows
