# Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio

Hey there! I’m Alan (@akaheric), a cybersecurity professional building hands-on skills in two of the most in-demand areas of cyber defense: **threat detection** and **vulnerability management**.

This GitHub repo is my personal lab where I document projects, queries, labs, and tools that I'm using to sharpen my skills — and show what I’m capable of.

## 🛡️ What You'll Find Here

### 1. **Azure Threat Detection (Blue Team)**
A collection of mini-projects, KQL queries, and lab notes focused on building detection capabilities using Microsoft Sentinel and Defender.

- **KQL Queries**:  
  Brute-force login detection, encoded PowerShell commands, and more
- **Mini Projects**:  
  Simulated attacks and detection case studies
- **TryHackMe Lab**:  
  Notes and screenshots from the Microsoft Sentinel room

> 📂 Folder: `Azure-Threat-Detection/`

### 2. **Vulnerability Management (Prevention + Analysis)**
Hands-on scanning using tools like Nessus Essentials and OpenVAS, with write-ups on remediation, CVE analysis, and reporting best practices.

- **Nessus Scan Projects**:  
  Full scans against vulnerable VMs like Metasploitable
- **Reporting Practice**:  
  Markdown-based reports + exported PDFs
- **Vuln Lifecycle Simulations**:  
  Ticketing, remediation, risk scoring

> 📂 Folder: `Vulnerability-Management/`

## 🔄 Why Combine Threat Detection and Vulnerability Analysis?

Good security isn't just about reacting — it's about **anticipating**.  
This portfolio reflects my mission to:
- Detect attacks **in real-time**
- Reduce the **attack surface**
- Become a well-rounded, job-ready security engineer

Whether it’s tuning a detection rule in Sentinel or patching an exposed service after a Nessus scan, I want to understand and improve the entire lifecycle.

## ✅ Goals for 2025

- Finish TryHackMe Blue Team Path
- Add 2–3 real detection use cases with simulated attacks
- Write 5+ vulnerability scan reports with recommendations
